What your SMS, Google Chat, WhatsApp and iMessage messages reveal about you

1. Export your messages:
   - **SMS / MMS:** back up your Android Google Messages chats using [SMS Backup & Restore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.riteshsahu.SMSBackupRestore).
   - **Google Chat:** go to [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/), click "Deselect all", select only **Google Chat**, and export as a **.zip**. Large exports are split into several zips (`takeout-…-001.zip`, `-002.zip`, …); download all of them. Dates are only understood when your Google account language is English.
   - **WhatsApp:** open a chat, then ⋮ / the contact or group name → **Export chat** (with or without media). Repeat for each chat you want; you get `WhatsApp Chat with ….txt` (Android) or `WhatsApp Chat - ….zip` (iPhone).
   - **iMessage:** on a Mac, install [imessage-exporter](https://github.com/ReagentX/imessage-exporter) (`brew install imessage-exporter`) and run `imessage-exporter -f txt` (add `-c clone` to also copy attachments, `-p <backup folder>` to read an iPhone backup instead). It writes one `.txt` per conversation to `~/imessage_export`; select them all, or zip the folder to include attachment sizes.
2. Navigate to https://yapalytics.online
3. Import the xml backup(s), Takeout zip(s), WhatsApp exports and/or iMessage `.txt` files. Pick every part of a split Takeout export together. WhatsApp exports don't say which sender is you; the app guesses, and you can correct it with **You on WhatsApp**.
4. Look at fancy graphs! When both kinds are loaded, use the All / SMS / Google Chat / WhatsApp / iMessage switch to compare them.

All processing occurs in the browser, your data is never uploaded anywhere!

## Development
The site is plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript with no build step: serve the folder (`npm run serve`, then open http://127.0.0.1:4173) and edit.

Tests need Node 22 or newer:

```sh
npm install
npx playwright install chromium   # once, for the browser tests
npm test                          # unit tests, then browser tests
npm run test:unit                 # just the logic (fast, no browser)
npm run test:e2e                  # just the browser tests
```

- `tests/unit/` load the app's scripts into Node and check the parsing and statistics.
- `tests/e2e/` drive the real page in Chromium with Playwright, using the demo data and small exports built in `tests/helpers/`. echarts and heic-to are served from `node_modules` at the same pinned versions the site loads from the CDN, so the tests don't need the network.
- GitHub Actions runs both on every push to `main` and on pull requests (`.github/workflows/test.yml`); when browser tests fail, the Playwright report is attached to the run.
